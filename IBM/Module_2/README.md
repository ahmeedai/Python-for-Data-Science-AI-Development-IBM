# Module 2: Python Data Structures

In this module, I explored Python’s built-in data structures: lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. These are essential for organizing and manipulating data efficiently, and they form the backbone of Python programming for data science.

## 📘 Learning Objectives
- Create and manipulate **lists** (indexing, slicing, adding, removing, updating).
- Work with **tuples** as immutable data containers.
- Build and access **dictionaries** using key-value pairs.
- Use **sets** for unique elements and perform set operations (union, intersection, difference).
