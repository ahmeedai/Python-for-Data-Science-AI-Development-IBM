# Python for Data Science, AI & Development (IBM - Coursera)

This repository contains my hands-on practice and solutions for the **IBM “Python for Data Science, AI & Development”** course on Coursera.  

The course introduces Python programming for data science, AI, and development, covering:
- Python basics (expressions, variables, data types, strings)
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive coding
- Foundational programming concepts useful in AI & Data Science
